# Synthetic Data Augmentation

This repo accompanies the FF25 research cycle focused on exploring the impact of synthetic data augmentation on tasks
associated with the [Severstal Steel Defect Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection)
dataset hosted on Kaggle.

## Downloading the data

Register an account on Kaggle, and download and unzip the data into the `data` subdirectory of this repo.
For most of the notebooks and scripts in this repo to work, the resulting directory structure should be:

```
data
├── sample_submission.csv
├── severstal-steel-defect-detection.zip
├── test_images
├── train.csv
└── train_images
```
